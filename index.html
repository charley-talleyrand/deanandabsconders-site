    <h1>This Site is About Dean & Associates</h1>
    <p><strong>How Two Accountants Stole From Us and Vanished</strong></p>
    <p>Welcome to our site. We're sharing our experience with an accounting firm that, unfortunately, did not deliver the services we paid for. Our goal is to raise awareness, help others avoid a similar situation, and encourage the parties involved to make things right.</p>
    <p>In late 2023, we sought help for filing international taxes. That decision led to a months-long deception by Asad and Rosalie of "Dean & Associates." They took our money, provided no services, and eventually taunted us after going silent.</p>
    <p><strong>This is what happened.</strong></p>

      <h2>Who We‚Äôre Talking About</h2>
      <p>This site documents our experience with Dean & Associates, the firm operated by Asad and Rosalie. You can visit their site here:</p>

      <p>This website is hosted by GoDaddy, a U.S.-based company that complies with U.S. laws, including those related to defamation and content removal.</p>
      <p>If anything here were false, Asad or Rosalie could take legal action to challenge it ‚Äî and they still can.</p>
      <p>We understand they might attempt to have the site taken down, even temporarily, through litigation tactics. But we‚Äôre confident that truth wins in the end. We‚Äôre not guessing, speculating, or exaggerating ‚Äî we‚Äôre the victims, and we‚Äôre simply telling the truth.</p>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em">In December 2023, we were referred to Rosalie Freidlin after initially contacting Asad at Dean & Associates. We had a complex tax situation, with spouses holding dual citizenships (U.S. and Canada). Rosalie spoke with us just before Christmas ‚Äî and in hindsight, subtly collected the details she‚Äôd need to make us vulnerable.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em">They stayed in contact for several months, stringing us along until they dropped the ruse in March 2024 and stopped responding.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Later, in December 2024, Rosalie sent a final email ‚Äî not to apologize, but to taunt us.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em">We had paid them through electronic transfers in Canada. After months of false hope, we engaged a legitimate firm. Our taxes were filed ‚Äî because we already had all the documents. The only thing missing was any work by Dean & Associates.</p>

    <h2>‚úÖ Verification Matters</h2>
    <p>After consulting police in both the U.S. and Canada, we were advised to verify the accountant registration numbers that Asad and Rosalie provided.</p>
    <p>The accountant numbers they gave us could not be confirmed by the appropriate authorities, despite multiple attempts on our part ‚Äî including police guidance to re-check them.</p>
    <p>At one point, a police officer even left a voicemail at their firm, requesting a response. They never replied.</p>
